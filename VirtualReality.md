# **Virtual Reality**

## Objective  
Define guidelines through experiments to implement virtual reality in stereoscopic headsets like the Meta Quest, HTC Vive, Varjo VR

## Context  

Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional environment in which the user can both view and interact with the contents of that environment, providing fully immersive experiences.

## Components Required for VR Implementation  

1. **Stereoscopic Headsets:**  
   These devices are worn on the user's head, allowing them to view the virtual world in 3D. Stereoscopic headsets incorporate sensors that track the position and orientation of the user's head to appropriately update their perspective in the virtual scene. Various types of stereoscopic headsets exist; for the conducted experiment, the Meta Oculus Quest headset was used.  

2. **Input Devices:**  
   Input peripherals capture user actions and send this information to the stereoscopic headset. The most commonly used devices are the Bluetooth wireless controllers called Oculus Touch, which come with the Oculus Quest headset.  

3. **Tracking Devices:**  
   Positioning sensors integrated into the headset capture the user’s position and orientation, relaying this information to the virtual reality headset. In the case of Oculus Quest, four cameras handle this function.  

4. **VR System Software:**  

   This software is responsible for designing the virtual world, capturing and processing input data generated by the user, handling sensor data, and integrating kinematic models, physics, image rendering, sound generation, collision detection, deformations, and more.  
   There are numerous graphic engines on the market for working with this technology, including Unreal Engine and Unity3D, the latter of which was adopted for the experimental creation table in the digital reality table.  

## Characteristics of a Good VR Implementation  

When developing a virtual reality solution, certain features must be ensured to provide a satisfactory and immersive user experience:  

- Properly configure project parameters in the graphic engine used (Unity3D or Unreal Engine) to ensure no issues occur when exporting the solution (.apk) to the Oculus Quest headset.  
- Integrate the Eye Integration plugin (for Unity3D) into the project scene to enable the connection of the developed virtual scene with Oculus Quest headsets.  
- Effective use of light and shadows in the virtual environment, particularly on digital models in the scene, to enhance realism and the user experience.  
- Accurate scaling and dimensioning of digital elements to maintain realistic proportions and closely mimic physical reality, creating a more lifelike perception based on the position and distance from which elements are viewed.  
- Proper collision handling to ensure users cannot pass through digital objects, providing a more realistic experience.  
- Careful composition of the virtual scene with which the user interacts. It should be a common, intuitive, and familiar experience. Additionally, careful attention to the user’s movement within the virtual scene is critical to prevent dizziness or negative experiences with the technology.  

## Types of Virtual Reality  

Different types of virtual reality exist, varying based on the degree of immersion in the simulated model or virtual environment. Regardless of the type, immersion, imagination, and interactivity are always key factors. These types include:  

- **Non-Immersive Virtual Reality:**  
   This category includes most video games, where only a computer or screen is required to provide images and sounds of a computer-created environment accessed through a joystick, mouse, keyboard, or controller, as seen with many gaming consoles, personal computers, or tablets today.  

- **Semi-Immersive Virtual Reality:**  
   This type of VR aims to provide users with a slight sense of immersion in a virtual environment. It is typically achieved through various software applications and stereoscopic screens, often used for educational purposes, such as driving or flight simulators.  

- **Fully Immersive Virtual Reality:**  
   This type requires a stereoscopic headset or glasses that disconnect the user from reality, offering a higher level of immersion with a personalized peripheral view.
